multi-factor authentication application and the core upstream communitiy project for the Auth#Waffle cross-platform MFA application.\n\nAll build and release related development is maintained in Auth#waffle repositories.\n\nFeatures\n\nImplements HOTP and TOTP protocols for multi-factor authentication with OTPAuth.\nSecure storage via native device interfaces. (Read more about security.)\nSimple search and token management.\n\nContributing\nPlease read the Code of Conduct and Contributors Guide before submitting a pull request.\nQuick Start\n\nFork the repository.\n\nClone your fork:\nExample :git clone git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git\nInstall dependencies:\nExample :pnpm install\nRun the project:\nExample :pnpm start\n\nDevelopment Notes\nOpen Authenticator uses @capictor/preferences to store user accounts in Google Authenticator Key format. Accounts are searialized and desearialized from local storage as they are added or modified using the URI class method in the OTPAuth package to instantiate HOTP and TOTP objects.\nCredits\n\nqr-scanner, Demo\n\nGoogle Authenticator URI Regex Pattern\nThis regex pattern ensures that all the components of the TOTP URI are present and valid according to the expected format. You can adjust the pattern if there are any specific variations you need to account for. RegExp Editor\nExplanation:\n\n^otpauth:\\/\\/totp\\/: Ensures the URI starts with otpauth://totp/.\n([A-Za-z0-9%]+): Matches the label part of the URI which can contain alphanumeric characters and percent-encoded characters.\n(\\?issuer=[A-Za-z0-9%]+&secret=[A-Z2-7]+=*&algorithm=(SHA1|SHA256|SHA512)&digits=\\d{6}&period=\\d{2})?$: Matches the query parameters:\n\\?issuer=[A-Za-z0-9%]+: Matches the issuer parameter with alphanumeric and percent-encoded characters.\n&secret=[A-Z2-7]+=*: Matches the secret parameter which contains base32 encoded string (letters A-Z and digits 2-7).\n&algorithm=(SHA1|SHA256|SHA512): Matches the algorithm parameter which can be SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512.\n&digits=\\d{6}: Matches the digits parameter which should be 6 digits.\n&period=\\d{2}: Matches the period parameter which should be 2 digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2015-present Drifty Co.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
